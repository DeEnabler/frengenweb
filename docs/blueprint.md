## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#2962FF), symbolizing innovation and trust. Its vibrant hue attracts the eye.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (#E5EAFE), maintains the focus on the content, not the background. Its brightness provides an effective light scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#9D39C4), is analogous to the primary, but shifted to give great contrast to blue elements.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif). Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) - a contemporary look for both headlines and body text, but especially fitting as a display face with the body typeface being a warmer choice.
- Modern, minimalist icons representing AI concepts and business solutions.
- Clean, tech-forward layout with clear calls-to-action and a focus on user experience.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance engagement and guide users through the content.
